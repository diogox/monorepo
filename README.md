# Monorepo

## Setup

This repo leverages Nix to install all dependencies automatically.

Then only dependencies we need to manually install are:
* [Nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix)
* [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)

Once they're installed, we just need to run:
```sh
direnv allow
```

And we're all done! :tada:
